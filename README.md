### 8 Bit Python Game
 My first attempt at making a platformer.

There's an engine file present in the data folder which serves as a blueprint for majority of the project.

Components included in the engine file:

Markup : - Parallax Scrolling
         - Character Flip Animation
         - Basic Movements
         - Audio
